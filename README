Available Patterns
==================

This pattern, /num*/, is not recursive meaning does not work for sub-folders/files ...
/num3/		for 001  , 002  , 003 ...
/num5/		for 00001, 00002, 00003 , ...
/num3+10/	for 010  , 011  , 012 ...
/num5+100/	for 00100, 00101, 00102 ...

To use original filename or the parent filename ...
/filename/	Original File Name
/name/		/filename/ without extension
/ext/		Only extension
/dir/		Parent Directory

To use Current time in filenames,
/date/		24Sep2008
/year/		2008
/month/		09
/monthname/	September
/monthsimp/	Sep
/day/		24
/dayname/	Wednesday
/daysimp/	Wed

You can also slice /filename/ and /name/, using /name:offset:length/. Length is optional, and both offset and length can be negative.
When they are negative, they are manipulated backwards (from end).

"123abc.jpg" => /filename:3/ => "abc.jpg"
"123abc.jpg" => /name:-3/  => "abc"
"123abc.jpg" => /name:0:-3/  => "abc"
"123abc.jpg" => /name:-3:3/  => "abc"
"123abc.jpg" => /name:-3:-3/ => "123"
"123abc.jpg" => /name:-3:100/ => "abc"
"123abc.jpg" => /name:-3:-100/ => "123"
